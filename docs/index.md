# RNA localization in smFISH images
This is a collection of analysis tools to study RNA localisation from smFISH images.

We provide different **analysis workflows** (you can select them from the banners). For each we detail the tools 
and their installations. 


We use a number of different **open-source software packages**, when necessasry we detail how to install them. 
 
* **RNA detection** is performed with the Matlab package FISH-quant (more details [below](#fish-quant-rna-detection)).
* Most postprocessing steps are performed with **Python plugins running ImJoy**. To use them, you have to install **Python with Jupyter** and the necessary **ImJoy plugins**. For more details see the respective sections below.
* Some annotation tasks are performed with **Fiji**, which you can download from [**here**](https://fiji.sc/).
