The zip archive contains data following the naming conventions of the examples below. Analysis overview \u00b6 For each RNA, we determine the closest distance of an RNA to a membrane. One thing to keep in mind more pixel close to the membrane than far away, e.g. in the centre of the cell. A simple example is a circle. The maximum distance that you can be away from the \u201cmembrane\u201d is the radius of the circle. However, there is only one possibility to be that far away (in the centre). However, there are many more \u201cclose\u201d positions. Plotting a histogram of the distance to the membrane for all possible positions in the circle, will yield a distribution that strongly enriched for small distances. To normalised for this effect, we calculate all possible distance from the membrane for a given cell with a distance transformation . This transformation results in an image, where the pixel values are not fluorescence intensities but distance values. An example is shown below. The blue lines are the cell outlines. The green dots are the detected RNAs. The image is the distance transform. The intensity values are distance to the membrane in pixels. We measure for all RNAs the distance to the membrane and calculate a histogram. We report the Raw RNA distance histogram. Normalised RNA histogram (values add to 1). Normalised distance histogram of all pixels in the cell. Normalised RNA histogram with the pixel histogram. Data organisation \u00b6 We enforce a strict data organisation for this analysis. More information about can be found in the dedicated section below. One folder per sample (\"parental folder\"). Images have to be stored as individual channels. More details for how to convert images are here . Each channel is saved as a separate .tif file containing all z-slices. Information for how to convert stacks can be found here are here . RNA molecules are detected with FISH-quant . Analysis results are also stored directly in the parental folder. RNA detection is described in more detail here . Membrane annotations are stored in a dedicated subfolder zstack_segmentation . More information below . As an example, we have one image img1 with 3 channels.

RNA detection \u00b6 Detection of RNAs is performed with FISH-quant and detailed here . Annotations of cell membrane \u00b6 In order to be able to compute the enrichment towards cell membrane or nuclear envelope, these membranes have to be annotated in EACH z-slice that should be considered in the analysis. Below we describe a manual annotation with FIJI, in the future automated segmentation results could be considered as well. Manual with FIJI \u00b6 Annotations have to be performed and stored as described below. For each multi-channel image, the annotations are stored in a dedicated sub-folder called zstack_segmentation . Each annotated z-slice has to be saved as an individual image and the file name has to end with the corresponding z-slice i in the format _Zi . For instance, file name ends with img1_ch3_Z3.tif , where 3 is the actual slice number. In FIJI , open the z-stack and go to menu Image > Stack > Stack to images . You can then save each image with the according file-name. Annotations are stored with the name of the corresponding image, with the additional suffix __RoiSet.zip . For the example above, the added suffix would be img1_ch3_Z3__RoiSet.zip . To perform the actual annotation , follow these steps Open FIJI. Open the ROI manager : Analyze > Tools > ROI manager Open/Select the image that you would like to annotate. Select the annotation tool of choice, e.g. freehand or polygon. Outline first structure of interest. When done, press Add(t) in the ROI manager to add outline to the out line manager. Proceed with all other structures. Enabling Show all , will show all defined regions. Save regions by highlighting all regions in the list and pressing on More >> Save ... If only one region is saved, this will created a file with the extension .roi , if multiple regions will be save this will create a .zip file. As a file-name choose the name of the annotated image, followed by the suffix **__RoiSet.zip** . IMPORTANT : these annotations could be used for training of a neural network. If this is intended, then ALL structures, e.g. nuclei, have to be annotated. Unwanted elements, e.g. nuclei touching the cell border, can be removed in a post-processing step. Analysis with ImJoy \u00b6 The entire functionality of the plugin can be controlled within the plugin window. If you expand the plugin, you will see all parameters and operations that can be performed Defining a root folder \u00b6 By default, ImJoy will open files in your home folder. If your data is at a different location, you can set a root folder. Each time you specify a file, ImJoy will open the file-dialog in this root folder. Press the button Root folder and specify the desired folder. The specified root folder is also saved, and will be resused the next time you launch ImJoy. Analysis options \u00b6 All options are explained in the Table below. If you change these parameters, the changed values will be saved in the browser and reused the next time you launch ImJoy. Option Type Default Description dZ int 2 Number of z-slices that will be used above and below the currently analyzed slice. Specify this value > 0 if not all z-slices are annotated/ Zmin int 0 Specify at which Z slice analysis should start. Value of 0 means that entire z-stack will be processed. Zmax int 0 As Z min but for maximum Z slice. Channel str 'C3-' Unique identifier for channel containing annotations. Hist [bin] int 20 Bin size for histogram to measure membrane enrichment (in nm). Hist [max] int 100 Maximum value for bins to calculate membrane enrichment. Image-size [X] int 960 Size of image in X. Image-size [Y] int 960 Size of image in Y. Launch an analysis and monitor progress \u00b6 To analyze a FQ results file, you have to Specify the required parameters in the plugin interface. Execute plugin with clicking on the Plugin name Membrane Enrichment . This will display a file-dialog where you can select the FQ results file that you want to analyze (ends with __spots.txt ) that should be analyzed. This file will then be processed and the final distance enrichment histogram displayed in the interface. More plots and results file will be stored on the disk. Once you start the analysis, ImJoy will show you a progress window with progressbars for the different steps. Once done, it will display the final result in this image. Stored results \u00b6 The analysis script will create a new folder with the same name as the selected results file. To allow to redo the analysis with different settings, the plugin will create for each performed analysis a separate sub folder MembDist_yymmdd-hhmm , where is a time-stamp in the format yymmdd-hhmm . This folder contains several files: _DistanceEnrichmentSummary.png : image containing the pooled analysis of all slices _HistogramPooled.csv : csv file containing the histograms of the RNA-membrane distance pooled from all z-slices. This can be opened with any Spreadsheet application (Excel, LibreOffice, Numbers, ...) and results from different images can then be pooled together. It contains the following data center : center of the bins histRNA_all : raw RNA distance histogram. histRNA_all_norm : normalized RNA histogram (values add to 1). histpix_all_norm : normalized distance histogram of all pixels in the cell. hist_RNA_all_normPix : normalized RNA histogram with the pixel histogram.

If you expand the plugin, you will see all parameters and operations that can be performed Defining a root folder \u00b6 By default, ImJoy will open files in your home folder. If your data is at a different location, you can set a root folder. Each time you specify a file, ImJoy will open the file-dialog in this root folder. Press the button Root folder and specify the desired folder. The specified root folder is also saved, and will be reused the next time you launch ImJoy. Loading data \u00b6 Here the FQ results and all image data are loaded. You have to specify the strings that specify the smFISH image and the granules image. For example, C1 and C3 for the data-set explained above. Once these parameters are specified, you can click on Load data . Here you have to specify the FQ results file that you want to analyze, e.g. C1-img1_res_GMM.txt for the example above. Important : make sure that the channel identifiers are correct, if you analyze another FISH channel. Granule detection \u00b6 Here, you can specify a threshold to detect granules. Lower value results in more detections. Click Test granule threshold to apply the currently selected threshold. Note that for testing thresholds the analysis is only performed on a 2D maximum intensity projection (otherwise it takes too long). Once the detection is finished, ImJoy will display a window with the results as shown below. Once you identified a good threshold, you can click on Detect granules in 3D , to perform the analysis on the full 3D image. Note : if you load a new FISH results from the same sample, you don't need to redo the granule detection. The ImJoy plugin stored the last analysis, and it can be reused. In this case, you only have to readjust the DB-scan parameters. DB-scan \u00b6 In order to identify RNA clusers, we anlalyze the 3D RNA positions with a DB-scan. Here you have to set two parameters Here spatial clusters are called based on two criteria (1) maximum allowed distance * eps : maximum allowed distance between spots within a cluster * Min samples : minimum number of spots to be considered as a cluster You can change these values and then perform an analysis by pressing on Perform DB-scan . ImJoy will again show an image with the analysis results. Co-localization analysis \u00b6 Once you are satisfied with the results, you can determine the co-localization between RNA clusters and granules by pressing Analyze co-localzation . Stored results \u00b6 The analysis script will create a folder coloc_granules in the sample folder. Here a separate folder for each analyzed channel is created. A number of images and csv files summarizing the analysis will be stored. iD_blob_detection__ABC-XYZ.png : results of the blob detection. iD : dimension of analyzed image (2D or 3D).

Granules are detected with a blob detection method (https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_blob.html). The user can adjust a threshold for the detection of these blobs. Spatial overlap of clusters and granules is then computed.","title":"Analysis overview"},{"location":"granules-coloc/#data-organisation","text":"We enforce the following data organisation for this analysis.

This distance is negative for an RNA inside a nucleus, and positive for an RNA outside of a nucleus. Distances for all RNAs will be summarised in histogram. These counts are then normalised as follows: Normalisation for complete spatial randomness. There is \"more space\" away from a nucleus than close to it. This means that for a randomly distributed RNA it is less likely to be close to a nucleus, then being further away.

This annotation can either be done manually, or automatically. If an automated segmentation is performed, make sure that the results are stored as described below for the manual annotation. Manual with FIJI \u00b6 Annotations have to be performed and stored as described below. For each multi-channel image, the annotations are stored in a dedicated sub-folder called zstack_segmentation . Each annotated z-slice has to be saved as an individual image and the file name has to end with the corresponding z-slice i in the format _Zi . For instance, file name ends with img1_ch3_Z3.tif , where 3 is the actual slice number. You can obtain the individual slices with different methods: FIJI . Open the z-stack and go to menu Image > Stack > Stack to images . You can then save each image with the according file-name. Annotations are stored with the name of the corresponding image, with the additional suffix __RoiSet.zip . For the example above, the added suffix would be img1_ch3_Z3__RoiSet.zip . To perform the actual annotation, follow these steps Open FIJI. Open the ROI manager : Analyze > Tools > ROI manager Open/Select the image that you would like to annotate. Select the annotation tool of choice, e.g. freehand or polygon. Outline first structure of interest. When done, press Add(t) in the ROI manager to add outline to the out line manager.

One other parameter that could be important to adjust is the cropping region around each RNA that is considered for analysis and fitting. Reducing this size allows sometimes to better detect closely spaced RNAs but at the cost of an imprecision in the fit. For most applications a value of +/- 2 voxels in XY and Z are a good compromise. Once you are satisfied with the settings press on Perform detection for all cells to return the main window. Press button Fit to fit each detected spot with a 3D Gaussian function. [Optional]. You can set threshold values for the different fitting parameters, e.g. remove spots with very small or very large standard deviations. You can now save the detection settings: [FQ] Main > Save > Save detection settings . As a file-name specify FQ__settings_MATURE.txt Depending on which analysis you want to perform, you either save the detection results or only the specified cell outline If you are satisfied with these detection results, you can save them directly: [FQ] Main > Save > Detection spots [All] . If you would like to also analyse RNA aggregates, you can save only the outline: [FQ] Main > Save > Outline of cells . Detection of clustered RNAs \u00b6 Her we use an approach that detects individual RNAs and then decomposes aggregates into individual RNAs (for more information see our Nature Communications paper ). This requires that the detection of individual RNA as described above has been performed. After performing the steps above you will have two text files (1) the cell outline, (2) FQ detection settings. The latter can be for an entire experiment or for individual outline files. Depending on how your data is organised a different workflow below will be adequate Detection settings for individual outline files \u00b6 Here, each outline has it's own settings file. We provide a script on the FQ BitBucket repository to analyse these data (WRAPPER_smFISH__GMM_v1.m) . The scripts requires that images, outlines, and settings are in the same folder. You have to specify a string that identifies outline files, and a string that identifies the settings files. Importantly, replacing one string by the other should then yield the respective other files. The script will then loop over all outlines, and process them with the GMM approach Results will stored in a newly created folder with the same name as the outline file. Here two subfolders are created, results_GMM contains the RNA detection with the GMM (to decompose foci into individual RNAs). The most important files are the text files ending with _res_GMM.txt containing the RNA detection results, which will be used to perform the co-localisation. The folder further contains a subfolder #plots with a PDF showing the results of the GMM detection. Individual RNAs are shown in green, decomposed foci with a red number indicating how many RNAs were estimated to be in each foci. results_noGMM contains the RNA detection results without the GMM. In the example below, the strings would be outlines.txt for outlines, and settings_MATURE.txt for the settings.

Inspect image. On the right part of the interface select Filtered image , disable outline , and double click on the image. This will show a maximum intensity projection of the filtered image in a separate window. Here, you can change the contrast and zoom. In order to determine an appropriate threshold in the next step, determine a generous range of intensities range corresponding to the individual RNA molecules. Set pre-detection settings . FQ will test how many RNAs are detected with a range of user-defined intensity thresholds (based on the manual inspection of the image from above). Open dedicated interface: Button Detect In the user-dialog change the first two parameter: minimum and maximum threshold to test. We usually use a minimum value that\u2019s somewhat lower than the lowest RNAs to also consider intensity value corresponding to background. FQ will calculate the number of detected RNAs for a range of values in this interval. Depending on the size of the image, this can take a little while. Once done, a plot with the number of detected RNAs as a function of the different thresholds is shown. If the specified range is not appropriate, it can be changed in this interface the computation be repeated. Ideally, this curve shows a plateau for a value range corresponding to a good detection threshold.
